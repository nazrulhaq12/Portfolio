# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **personal portfolio website** built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.  
It showcases my projects, skills, and contact information in a clean, modern design.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** – component-based UI
- ⚡ **Vite** – fast build tool
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling
- 🌍 **GitHub Pages** – hosting & deployment

👉 Do you want me to also **add badges** (like React, Vite, Tailwind, GitHub Pages) at the top for a more polished look?
